# Plagiarism Checker System (IoD & UCD)

## Overview

This project comprises three images detailing the architecture and processes for a plagiarism checker system using IoD (Interaction Overview Diagram) and UCD (Use Case Diagram) methodologies. The system is designed to streamline the assignment submission, plagiarism detection, and grading process for both students and professors.

### Documents Included

1. IoD- For Plagiarism Checker.pdf
     * Contains the IoD diagram illustrating the assignment submission and evaluation workflow, including manual and automated code review processes.

2. Plagiarism checker - IOD & UCD Combined (final).pdf
     * Presents a combined view of the IoD and UCD diagrams. It includes a detailed flow of assignment submission, automated testing, plagiarism checking (e.g., via Turnitin), and the generation of automated grades and reports.

3. Ucd- Plagiarism checker.pdf
     *Provides the UCD (Use Case Diagram) for the programming assignment system. This document covers the roles of students, professors, and the Learning Management System (LMS) in managing assignments, running plagiarism checks, and syncing grades.
