# Road Warrior Architecture Characteristics Analysis

## Project Overview
**The Road Warrior** is a next-generation online trip management dashboard being developed for a major travel agency. The system will allow travelers to view all their existing reservations organized by trip, accessible via website or mobile application.

### Users
- 10,000+ registered users worldwide

### Requirements
1. The system must interface with the agency's existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to automatically load reservations via frequent flier accounts, hotel membership point accounts, and car rental rewards accounts.
2. Customers should be able to add existing reservations manually as well.
3. Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed from the dashboard.
4. Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites.
5. Richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms.

### Additional Context
1. Must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems.
2. Partnership deals are being negotiated to create 'favored' vendors.
3. Must work internationally.

## Driving Characteristics Analysis

### 1. Interoperability
(The ability of the system to interface and interact with other systems to complete a business request)

**Reason**  
The system functionality depends on external system connectivity because Requirement (1) demands it needs to link with existing airline-hotel-car rental interface software. Moreover the additional context specifies that the system needs full integration capability with all present travel systems. Strong interoperability remains essential for the application to achieve its main delivery objectives.

**Use Case**  
When a user registers their frequent flyer account, hotel loyalty program, and car rental rewards program , the system must be able to authenticate with each of these disparate systems, retrieve reservation data using their specific APIs, and normalize this data into a consistent format for display in the dashboard. Each external system likely has its own authentication methods, data formats, and communication protocols, requiring robust interoperability capabilities. Furthermore, Requirement (4) requires interfacing with standard social media sites for sharing trip information, adding another dimension of interoperability requirements.

### 2. Scalability
(A function of system capacity and growth over time; as the number of users or requests increase in the system, responsiveness, performance, and error rates remain constant)

**Reason**  
The Road Warrior system will serve 10,000+ registered users worldwide, accessing the system across different time zones and from various devices. The global distribution of users creates varying usage patterns throughout the day, with potential spikes during travel disruptions when many users simultaneously access the system. Additionally, as the travel agency grows its customer base or expands into new markets, the system must scale accordingly without degradation in service quality.

**Use Case**  
During a major weather event affecting multiple airports in Europe, thousands of travelers may simultaneously access the dashboard to check for updates to their itineraries or make alternative arrangements. The system must maintain consistent performance despite this sudden increase in load. Similarly, during peak travel seasons (summer holidays, winter holidays), overall system usage will increase significantly as more travelers are actively managing their trips. The architecture must be designed to scale efficiently during these predictable and unpredictable usage spikes while maintaining consistent performance for all users regardless of their geographic location.

### 3. Performance
(The amount of time it takes for the system to process a business request)

**Reason**  
As a travel management dashboard used by people who are often on the go, performance is critical for user satisfaction and utility. Users need quick access to their travel information, especially in time-sensitive situations like checking flight details at an airport or finding hotel information upon arrival at a destination. The requirement for the "richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms" also demands strong performance to ensure complex UI components load and function smoothly across both web and mobile interfaces.

**Use Case**  
A business traveler arriving at an airport needs to quickly check their flight details, including gate information and any last-minute changes. The system must quickly retrieve this information from the airline's reservation system, process it, and display it to the user within seconds, even if the user is on a mobile device with a less-than-optimal connection. Performance in this context includes not just UI responsiveness but also the efficiency of backend processing and data retrieval from multiple external systems. Poor performance would significantly impact user satisfaction and could potentially cause travelers to miss critical travel information, especially when dealing with last-minute changes or disruptions to their itineraries.
